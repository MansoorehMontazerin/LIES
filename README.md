## *** Sparse Interpretable Deep Learning with LIES Networks for Symbolic Regression ***


<br>

This repository contains the official implementation of the LIES Network for symbolic regression. LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine) is a neural architecture designed to learn symbolic expressions by combining interpretable activations with sparsity-promoting training and pruning techniques.

###  ðŸš€ Usage

First install the dependancies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And then, run the pipeline with:
```
python lies_pipeline.py
```

###  	:card_file_box: Dataset

We have tested LIES on the Feynman symbolic regression dataset found in this [website](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/aifeynman.html).
